@brief Theme selection smoke test for the gestion_stock application
@details This script verifies that the gestion_stock binary launches properly 
         and initializes the theme selection (specifically the 'Classic' theme).
         It serves as a prerequisite check before running deeper menu-level tests.
@note Ensure the gestion_stock application is built and the binary path is correct.
